// Find the row with maximum number of 1's
// Problem Statement: You have been given a non-empty grid ‘mat’ with 'n' rows and 'm' columns consisting
// of only 0s and 1s. All the rows are sorted in ascending order.
// Your task is to find the index of the row with the maximum number of ones.
// Note: If two rows have the same number of ones, consider the one with a smaller index. 
// If there's no row with at least 1 zero, return -1.

// traverse the matrix:
